We will use a three-layer approach to structure styling throughout the site: (global → layout → component-specific). 
It will work as follows 

// 1. base.scss - Foundation layer
// CSS reset, font imports, CSS custom properties (variables)
// Nothing that creates visual styles, just the groundwork

// 2. main.scss - Layout and composition
// spacing, arrangement & high-level structure for container elements within components
// Focus on how component arrangement in the page and their internal layout


// 3. Component <style scoped> - Specific decoration
// Your current level 3 - component-specific visual styling


Additionally, there  might be a utilities.scss for helper classes and accessiblity:

// Small, single-purpose classes for common patterns
// .visually-hidden, .flex-center, .text-truncate, etc.
